//! The index record: one entry per tracked node file (ODD-0014 §3.1).
//!
//! An [`IndexRecord`] is the persisted, derived stat-cache entry for a node — the
//! shape the cold-path build (slice02) fills from a corpus walk and the warm path
//! (slice03) `lstat`-compares against. It carries three layers:
//!
//! 1. **identity** — the node's [`Id`] (its filename stem, the canonical key) and
//!    its `rel_path` (for I/O and deletion detection);
//! 2. **stat-cache fields** — `mtime`/`size`/`inode`/`mode`, the cheap
//!    change-detection signal (git/hg/jj's pattern); and
//! 3. **fingerprints + extracted metadata** — a `content_hash` (raw bytes) and a
//!    `meta_hash` (normalized metadata, the early-cutoff key), plus the metadata
//!    needed for in-memory filter/sort without re-parsing.
//!
//! This module defines the *type only*; populating a record from a real file is
//! slice02's job.
